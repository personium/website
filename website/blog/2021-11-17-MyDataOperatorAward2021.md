The MyData Operator Award recognises personal data companies that have shown leadership by empowering individuals to control their personal data. As highlighted by the ongoing Facebook Files scandal, transparency and accountability in personal data are increasingly acknowledged as critical for safety online.  To show their commitment to ethical personal data management, participating organisations are required to disclose information about their operations. The MyData Operator Award shows that ethical alternatives exist and provide value for companies and users alike.   

Taking an ethical data approach builds trust with our customers, investors and partnerships. Personium is proud to receive the award two years in a row!
