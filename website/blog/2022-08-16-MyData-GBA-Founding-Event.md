MyData Greater Bay Area was formally established in 2021 September, with the aim for introducing the concept of MyData. We strive to provide the GBA with a campaign on promoting the autonomy of personal information, transforming personal data into tangible assets and maximizing its utility in order to serve the digital economy. Personal data will become the driving force for digital transformation and economic development, as well as an effective tool for social governance.
