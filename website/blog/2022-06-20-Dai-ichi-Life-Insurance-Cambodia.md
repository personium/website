Before attending the Cambodia ICT Camp 2022, Personium Chief Evangelist, Dixon Siu, gives a presentation on [Personal Data Empowerment with Personium](https://dixonsiu.pds.mydataasia.org/Cambodia/Dai-ichi_Life/Personal_Data_Empowerment_with_Personium.pdf) and shares use cases with the Chief Executive Officer and data engineers at Dai-ichi Life Insurance (Cambodia) PLC.  

At the end of the presentation, we agree that personal data empowerment and utilisation are important because:  
- it is more efficient to connect the data silos within organisations  
- it is easier to provide added value services with shared personal data  
- privacy laws are taking shape even in Cambodia    
- it aligns with Cambodia's national project CamDX

Public Private People Partnership - Private sectors have to be involved as the government cannot proceed alone.
