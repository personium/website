-------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

Describe the basic settings and considerations for the environment constructed with Ansible.
By performing this procedure, you can understand the installation location and basic settings of the main middleware that makes up Personium.

## Web service

* Check the basic settings of the server on which the Web service runs.

### Nginx

* Personium uses Nginx to realize the Web.
Nginx is installed as follows.

| item                    | path                                |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Install Directory       | /opt/nginx-1.14.0/                  |
| Config Files            | /opt/nginx-1.14.0/conf/             |
| Log Directory           | /personium/nginx/log/accesslog_443/ |  

### Server Certificate

* Personium is a service provided by HTTPS. Confirm the setting of the server certificate used to realize HTTPS.

1. First, check the path of the server certificate used by Nginx.
   To check the path of the currently used server certificate Execute the following command and confirm the item "ssl_certificate" "ssl_certificate_key".

    ```console
    # cat /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
    ```

    Immediately after construction, it is as follows.

    ```
    ssl_certificate         /opt/nginx/conf/server.crt
    ssl_certificate_key     /opt/nginx/conf/server.key
    ```

1. Check the contents of the server certificate you are using.
   Execute the following command to check the common name of the server certificate.

    ```console
    # openssl x509 -noout -subject -in /opt/nginx/conf/server.crt
    ```

    When creating as in the example of creating a server certificate described in [1-server_unit/README](https://github.com/personium/ansible/tree/master/1-server_unit) or [3-server_unit/README](https://github.com/personium/ansible/tree/master/3-server_unit), It is displayed as follows. CN must represent common name and must match FQDN when accessing with HTTPS protocol.

    ```
    subject= /C=XXX/L=Default City/O=Default Company Ltd/CN=personium.example.com
    ```

## AP service

Check the basic settings of the server on which the AP service runs.

### Tomcat environment

* Personium uses Tomcat to realize the AP.
  Tomcat is installed as follows.

| Item                          | Path                                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Install Directory             | /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.10/          |
| Config Files                  | /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.10/conf/     |
| Log Directory                 | /personium/tomcat/logs/             |
| Application Directory         | /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.10/webapps/  |  

### Unit Certificate

* Personium is an important file using unit certificates with various functions such as access token verification.

1. First, check the path of the unit certificate currently in use. The unit certificate is specified in the file personium-unit-config.properties.
    * Execute the following command to check the file.  

    ```console
    # cat /personium/personium-core/conf/18888/personium-unit-config.properties | grep ^io.personium.core.x509
    ```

    The environment automatically constructed with Ansible has the following settings.
    
    ```
    io.personium.core.x509.root=/opt/x509/unit-self-sign.crt
    io.personium.core.x509.crt=/opt/x509/unit-self-sign.crt
    io.personium.core.x509.key=/opt/x509/unit.key
    ```

1. Check the common name of the unit certificate. At this time, the common name of the unit certificate must match the FQDN of its own Personium Unit.
    * You can check the unit certificate information by executing the following command.

    ```console
    # openssl x509 -noout -subject -in /opt/x509/unit-self-sign.crt
    ```

    * When created as shown in the example of creation of unit certificate described in [How to generate Self-signed Unit Certificate](https://github.com/personium/ansible/blob/master/How_to_generate_Self-signed_Unit_Certificate.md), it is displayed as follows. The CN should represent the common name and it must match the FQDN for HTTPS access.

    ```
    subject= /C=XXX/L=Default City/O=Default Company Ltd/CN=personium.example.com
    ```

### Personium environment

* Personium is installed as follows.

| Item                          | Path                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| personium-core                | /opt/tomcat/webapps/                                                  |
| personium-engine              | /opt/tomcat/webapps/                                                  |
| personium-core Log Directory  | /personium/personium-core/log/personium-core.log                      |
| personium-engine Log Directory| /personium/personium-engine/log/personium-engine.log                  |
| Unit Config File              | /personium/personium-core/conf/18888/personium-unit-config.properties |  

* By changing personium-unit-config.properties, you can change [Unit configurations](../server-operator/unit_config_list.md) from the default.  
    Immediately after construction with Ansible, it is set as follows.  
    \* {} Means that the contents defined in hosts changed before Ansible execution are described.  
    \* {{}} Indicates that a randomly determined character string is described when Ansible is executed.

    ```

#### Unit Master Token

* The value described in "io.personium.core.masterToken" of "personium-unit-config.properties" is the Unit master token. The unit master token initial settings can also be confirmed by executing the following command on the server that executed Ansible.

    ```console
    # echo `grep "master_token" ~/ansible/static_inventory/hosts | sed -e "s/master_token=//" | uniq`
    ```

> The Unit master token can also be confirmed by referring to "io.personium.core.masterToken" of "personium-unit-config.properties" described in the above Personium environment.

**Refer to [Unit security (settings that should be changed from default)](unit_security.md) for how to disable the Unit master token.**

#### Personium Unit Management Account

* Running Ansible will automatically create a Personium Unit administration account. This information is required for the Personium Unit administrator to perform administrative work such as creating cells.

    Confirm ID/PASS of Unit management account

    * To get the information, log in to the server where Ansible was executed and execute the following command.

    ```console
    $ sudo su-
    # cat /root/ansible/unitadmin_account
    unitadmin_account={unitadmin_account}
    unitadmin_password={unitadmin_password}
    Personium_FQDN={Personium_FQDN}
    ```

    * {Personium_FQDN} FQDN of Personium Unit
    * {unitadmin_account} Unit admin account
    * {unitadmin_password} Unit management password

> **(Caution)**
> **The information acquired here is the initial value, so if the user changes it, please manage it yourself.**

## DB service

* Check the settings of the server on which the Elasticsearch service runs.

### Elasticsearch environment

* Personium uses Elasticsearch to realize DB.
  Elasticsearch is installed as follows.  
  For version,Please check the version of elasticsearch [here](https://github.com/personium/ansible#middleware-on-vm).
